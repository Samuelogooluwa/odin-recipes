        <h2>How to Store Air Fryer Pork Chops</h2>

       <p>Store leftover pork chops in an airtight storage container or tightly wrapped 
        in foil in the refrigerator for up to three days. Reheat in an oven set to 350 degrees F
         (with a few drops of broth or water to prevent dryness) until the pork is heated through. </p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
    
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Combine Parmesan cheese, paprika, garlic powder, salt, parsley,
                 and pepper in a flat shallow dish; mix well.</li>
           
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Coat each pork chop with olive oil. Dredge both sides of each 
                chop in the Parmesan mixture and set on a plate.</li>
    
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Place 2 chops in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes; 
                flipping halfway through cook time. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.
                 Repeat with remaining chops.</li>

        </ul>
    
        <h3>Recipe Tip</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For easy cleanup and less mess, mix Parmesan mixture in a 
                long flat-lidded plastic to-go container. Place one chop in at a time, 
                snap the lid, and shake. Transfer coated chop to a plate and repeat with remaining chops. 
                Perfectly coated chops every single time!</li>
